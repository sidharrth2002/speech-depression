2023-04-04 13:45:43.752606: I tensorflow/core/util/util.cc:169] oneDNN custom operations are on. You may see slightly different numerical results due to floating-point round-off errors from different computation orders. To turn them off, set the environment variable `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=0`.
Could not find image processor class in the image processor config or the model config. Loading based on pattern matching with the model's feature extractor configuration.

INFO:root:Using multi-class classification
Some weights of ASTForAudioClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at MIT/ast-finetuned-audioset-10-10-0.4593 and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- classifier.dense.weight: found shape torch.Size([527, 768]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([5, 768]) in the model instantiated
- classifier.dense.bias: found shape torch.Size([527]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([5]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
