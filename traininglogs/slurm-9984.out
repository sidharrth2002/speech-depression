Some weights of ASTForAudioClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at MIT/ast-finetuned-audioset-10-10-0.4593 and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- classifier.dense.weight: found shape torch.Size([527, 768]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([5, 768]) in the model instantiated
