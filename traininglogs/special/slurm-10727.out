2023-04-23 16:35:41.573849: I tensorflow/core/util/util.cc:169] oneDNN custom operations are on. You may see slightly different numerical results due to floating-point round-off errors from different computation orders. To turn them off, set the environment variable `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=0`.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at MIT/ast-finetuned-audioset-10-10-0.4593 were not used when initializing ASTModel: ['classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.layernorm.bias', 'classifier.dense.bias', 'classifier.layernorm.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing ASTModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing ASTModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Could not find image processor class in the image processor config or the model config. Loading based on pattern matching with the model's feature extractor configuration.
