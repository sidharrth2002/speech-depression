2023-03-30 00:05:42.030487: I tensorflow/core/util/util.cc:169] oneDNN custom operations are on. You may see slightly different numerical results due to floating-point round-off errors from different computation orders. To turn them off, set the environment variable `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=0`.
Some weights of ASTForAudioClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at MIT/ast-finetuned-audioset-10-10-0.4593 and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- classifier.dense.weight: found shape torch.Size([527, 768]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([25, 768]) in the model instantiated
- classifier.dense.bias: found shape torch.Size([527]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([25]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Could not find image processor class in the image processor config or the model config. Loading based on pattern matching with the model's feature extractor configuration.
